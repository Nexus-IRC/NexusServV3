 This command will temporarily add a ban for the user specified as the parameter. Masks are to be supplied in the format <Nick>!<Ident>@<Host> and usually contain wildcards. If a nick is specified, a mask is automatically generated (though not completely foolproof). This ban is removed either by removing it from the channel banlist using any IRC client, or sending the DELBAN or UNBANALL commands.
 Example: *!*serv@*.user.OnlineGamesNet would ban anyone with the ident 'serv' and a user.OnlineGamesNet hostname from joining the channel.

[ADDTIMEDBAN]
 /msg $B ADDTIMEDBAN <#channel> <mask|nick> <Duration> [Reason]
 Adds an automatically expiring ban to the channel banlist. This command behaves in the exact same fashion as ADDBAN with the exception that the bans are automatically removed after the user-supplied duration.

Timed bans can be removed with the DELBAN command, as with permanent bans.
