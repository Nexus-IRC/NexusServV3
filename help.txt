[ACCESS]

 Reports various pieces of information about a channel user, including channel and network access level, and the user's infoline. If no nick or account is provided, $B returns your own information.
[MYACCESS]
 /msg $B MYACCESS [<nick|*account>]
 Lists channels where you have access and infolines for each.
 Staff may specify a nickname or *account to view the list for another user.
 Your access level in the channel may be followed by a comma and one of the following characters:
   s     Your access in the channel has been suspended
   o     AutoOp is active
   v     AutoVoice is active
   i     AutoInvite is active
[CLVL]
 /msg $B CLVL <#channel> <nick|*account> <level>
 Modifies a channel user's access level. You cannot give users access greater than or equal to your own.
 You may use *Account instead of Nick as the name argument; the * makes $B use the name of a account directly (useful if the user is not online).

 /msg $B ADDUSER <#channel> <nick|*account> <level>
 This command adds someone to the channel userlist with the specified access level.  (You may only add users to levels less than your own.)

[DELUSER]
 /msg $B DELUSER <#channel> <nick|*account>
 Deletes a user from the channel userlist.
 You may use *Account instead of Nick as the name argument; the * makes $B use the name of a account directly (useful if the user is not online).
