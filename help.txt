[ACCESS]
 /msg $B ACCESS <#channel> [<nick|*account>]
  Reports various pieces of information about a channel user, including channel and network access level, and the user's infoline. If no nick or account is provided, $B returns your own information.
[CLVL]
 /msg $B CLVL <#channel> <nick|*account> <level>
  Modifies a channel user's access level. You cannot give users access greater than or equal to your own.
  You may use *Account instead of Nick as the name argument; the * makes $B use the name of a account directly (useful if the user is not online).
